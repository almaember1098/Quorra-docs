## CSRF Protection

### Adding The CSRF Token To A Form

Quorra provides an easy method of protecting your application from cross-site request forgeries. First, a random token
is placed in your user's session. You can use following methods to access and regenerate tokens. Include the token in
 your html form as a hidden field with `_token` as field name.

### Access CSRF token

```javascript
req.session.getToken()
// or
req.csrfToken()
```

### Regenerate CSRF token

```javascript
req.session.regenerateToken()
```

### Attaching The CSRF Filter To A Route

```javascript
Route.post('profile', {'before': 'csrf', 'uses': function() {
    //
});
```
## Quorra Behind Proxies

When running an Quorra app behind a proxy, set the configuration value `trustProxy`(app/config/request.js) to one of the
values listed in the following table.

> **Note:** Although the app will not fail to run if the configuration value `trustProxy` is not set, it will incorrectly
register the proxy’s IP address as the client IP address unless `trustProxy` is configured.

Setting a non-false trust proxy value results in three important changes:

The value of req.hostname is derived from the value set in the X-Forwarded-Host header, which can be set by the client or by the proxy.

`X-Forwarded-Proto` can be set by the reverse proxy to tell the app whether it is https or http or even an invalid
name. This value is reflected by req.protocol.

The req.ip and req.ips values are populated with the list of addresses from `X-Forwarded-For`.

The trust proxy setting is implemented using the [proxy-addr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-addr) package. For more information, see its documentation.

## Application Locals

In Quorra local variables within the application can be saved to locals attribute of Quorra application instance, ie
`App.locals`.

```javascript
App.locals.title
// => 'My App'

App.locals.email
// => 'me@myapp.com'

App.locals.strftime = require('strftime');
```

Once set, the value of `App.locals` properties persist throughout the life of the application, in contrast with `res
.locals` properties that are valid only for the lifetime of the `request`.

Both `app.locals` and `res.locals` properties are available in aplication view templates. This is useful for
providing helper functions to templates, as well as app-level data. Application locals are available in `middleware`
 via `req.app.locals` (see [req.app](/docs/{{version}}/more/request.md#reqapp)).
